# Spotify Data Exploration

College students, including us, love listening to music! It helps us focus and gives everyone a break from all the studying, homework assignments, and projects.

Listeners love to find new music to help them de-stress and/or connect with others but it can be hard to find new music which users will actually enjoy. Users tend to listen to music of their liking and preference and Spotify generates characteristics for each song: danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms, and time signature.

Our research went in two directions:

Using these characteristics, it is possible to come up with our own metrics, such as how happy a song may be, by weighting these features differently. In addition, all of our group members acknowledge how usually the songs a person listens to reflect their own state of being. With these experiences and knowledge in mind, a question we asked ourselves is "Can we tell how happy the residents of a country are based on the music they listen to?" In addition, can we find a correlation between this happiness metric and other metrics such as GDP to determine whether money really does equal happiness?

In this increasingly globalized world we live in, can we still differentiate countries by the songs they listen to? When manually looking through countries' "Top 50" playlists, we found English music in the India playlist and other similar cultural combinations. Will we find any other interesting similarities between what countries are listening to? More specifically, "Will we find unexpected countries in the same song clusters?"
